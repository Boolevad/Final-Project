# Timer Extension
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This project was developed as my final project for Harvard University's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) Introduction to Computer Science Course.

It is a simple google chrome Timer extension that lets you keep track of your desired activity.

### How to use:
**You can get the extension from here:**

After installing the extension, the user can add their desired activity by clicking the plus button and typing the name of the activity.

Then the user can start the timer by clicking the play/pause button and underneath the activity box will be displayed the time elapsed, while the hourglass will start spinning.

Pressing the stop button, both the timer and the hourglass reset to the starting position.

Then the user can press the plus button again to clear the activity box and add a new activity.

### How it works:

The project consists of 4 main files and 4 png files used to demonstrate the buttons and icons used.
- `manifest.json` contains
- `popup.html`
- `popup.css`
- `popup.js`
